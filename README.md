# FizzBuzz implemented using python
I've used a generator to keep the memory footprint low.

## How to Run

Tested in python 3

In your terminal run `python fizzbuzz/runner.py`

Or if you'd rather use docker you can run `docker-compose build && docker-compose up`

## Testing

tests can be run using `pytest`
